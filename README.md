# North Sea Buoy Displacement Analysis

This repository contains code and data for an analysis fitting spectral models to buoy displacement data.

To use, clone the repository and then start Julia and navigate to the directory folder.
Follow the [instructions](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1.2/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project-1) for setting up Julia environments.

The following files should be used to run the analysis:
- exampleanalysis.jl: Run the analysis on the example data set.
- simulation.jl: Run the simulation study comparing a variety of techniques.
- figures.jl: Generate figures from results of the previous two files.
